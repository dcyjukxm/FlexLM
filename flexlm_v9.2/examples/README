This directory contains several sub-directories with example 
license files and code.  

 
    advanced      - Advanced examples, including:
                    exinstal.c  -- example license installer 
                                   program
                    get_dir.c   -- gets directory in $PATH

                                   license file location
                    licstring.c -- sample licensed application that
                                   incorporates a "license in a buffer"

These examples are intended to provide instruction in the 
use of various FLEXlm features. They are unsupported and
may not exist in future FLEXlm Software Development Kits.
While we have made every effort to insure that these examples are 
correct, they are not intended to be release-quality debugged 
products. 

For developers new to FLEXlm, please read Chapters 1-6 of the 
Programmers Guide.  

In addition to the files in this directory,
FLEXlm-licensed application examples are provided in the machind
directory of the Software Development Kit:


     <install_dir>/flexlm/v9.0/machind (UNIX)
