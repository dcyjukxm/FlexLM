        o lmgrd can read multiple license files
Done.
        o FLEXlm license path can specify a directory, which automatically
          includes "*.lic" in that directory.
Done.
        o License files require no editing for use at the end-user
          site.  Previously, the end-user had to edit the license
          file to specify, at a minimum, the path to the vendor
          daemon, but also the hostname, lmgrd TCP port number, and
          path to the vendor-daemon options file.  For most sites
          none of these items need editing by end-users.
Done.
        o The path to the daemon (on the DAEMON line) is now optional.
          If unspecified, the $PATH is searched to start the vendor daemon.
Done
        o Licenses can now be shipped in a compressed, largely decimal
          format, which is designed to be easy to type in for
          customers that don't have access to email.
Done.
        o Feature lines are shorter, easier to understand and type in.
        o PACKAGE lines can be shipped in separate files that
          never require user editing.
Done.
        o The SERVER port number is now optional.  If left unspecified,
          FLEXlm default port numbers (27000-27009) are automatically used.
Done.
        o End-user options file does not need to be specified in
          the license file.  A default file name is automatically used:
          the vendor-daemon name, with ".opt" suffix, in the same
          directory where licenses are stored.
Done.
        o License information can now be stored in a buffer in the
          program, instead of a file.
Done.
        o Hostname on SERVER line can use the default "this_host", which
          works fine when using LM_LICENSE_FILE set to port@host, or
          if clients are on the same node as the server.  Makes initial
          installation easier.
Done.
        o License path can be set with a different environment variable
          for each vendor (in addition to LM_LICENSE_FILE):
          vendor_LICENSE_FILE (e.g., "GSI_LICENSE_FILE").
Done.
        o License path (via LM_LICENSE_FILE or vendor_LICENSE_FILE)
          can be set to "@host", if the server uses a default port
          number.
Done.
        o License files are case-insensitive.
Done
        o Optional START=... start-date in license file.
Done

        Other Enhancements:

        o Improved security
        o Improved error message handling
        o Alternative error message available: paragraph format with
          - 1-3 line error message, describing error, and possible
            workarounds
          - feature name (if applicable)
          - license path
          - context-sensitive information (where applicable).
Done.
        o API for verifying license key in FEATURE line
Done.
