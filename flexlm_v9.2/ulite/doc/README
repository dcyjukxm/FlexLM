OVERVIEW

    The FLEXlm ulite project is a sub-project of FLEXlm.
There is no "flexlmulite" directory at the top of the
CVS repository; rather the desired sub-components of
FLEXlm for ulite are described in CVSROOT/modules.

    The command "cvs checkout flexlmulite" executes
several checkout aliases that build, from the hierarchical
FLEXlm project, the flat ulite project.  Because of this
there are special considerations required when dealing
with ulite.

SUBPROJECT MAPPING

    This table shows the mapping of files between FLEXlm
and the ulite project:

         FLEXlm                            ULITE
         ------                            -----
        src/l_crypt.c                flexsrc/l_crypt.c
            l_key.c                          l_key.c
            l_strkey.c                       l_strkey.c

          h/l_privat.h                     h/l_privat.h
            l_prot.h                         l_prot.h
            l_strkey.h                       l_strkey.h
            lgetattr.h                       lgetattr.h
            lm_comm.h                        lm_comm.h
            lmachdep.h                       lmachdep.h

    machind/lmclient.h               machind/lmclient.h

        ulite/src/*                       src/*
    ulite/release/*                   release/*
        ulite/mfg/*                       mfg/*
       ulite/test/*                      test/*
      ulite/utils/*                     utils/*

    Note that the directories, src, release, mfg, test and utils
are merely moved up to the root level of the ulite project.  But
the directories flexlmsrc, h and machind hold only a subset of
what can be found in their FLEXlm counterparts.

CHECKING OUT ULITE

    1) Use a standard CVS command:

		cvs checkout flexlmulite

    This will create a flexlmulite directory in the
    proper flat format (i.e. not under a "ulite"
    directory as found in the FLEXlm project).

ADDING FILES 

    Adding files to the ulite directories (src, release, mfg, test)
is straight forward:

		cvs add <new file>
		cvs commit

This adds the file to the repository.  It will be available for
any future checkout.

    Adding files to the reference directories (flexsrc, h, machind)
is more complicated because the contents of those directories
has been fixed in the project definition.  To add a file there:

		cvs add <new file>
		cvs commit
		cd <workarea directory>
		cvs checkout CVSROOT/modules
		cd CVSROOT
		vi modules  (... and add the file to the ulite description)
		cvs commit

CREATING A RELEASE

    1) Tag the current development as the release.  To release 7.5:

		cvs tag -F -r flexulite-v7_5

       Note the use of "-F" to force the tag if it already exists.
       Also note the tag name preface:  "flexulite".  This is
       especially important for ulite because it shares files with
       the FLEXlm project.  By prefacing the tag with the name of the
       product, we can easily tell to which project a tag belongs.

BUILDING A RELEASE

    1) Create a fresh, read-only, copy:

		cd <release area>
		cvs -r checkout -r flexulite-v7_5 flexulite

    2) Continue with the build process.
